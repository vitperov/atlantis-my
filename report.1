gate lore [GATE] 1: Gate Lore is the art of detecting and using

  number and the Gate's location. A mage with skill 1 in Gate Lore can
  see a Gate if one exists in the same region as the mage. This
  detection is automatic; the Gate will appear in the region report. A
  mage with skill 1 in Gate Lore may also jump through a Gate into
  another region on the same level containing a gate, selected at
  random. To use Gate Lore in this manner, use the syntax CAST
  Gate_Lore RANDOM UNITS <unit> ... UNITS is followed by a list of
  units to follow the mage through the Gate (the mage always jumps
  through the Gate). At level 1, the mage may carry 15 weight units
  through the Gate (including the weight of the mage). This skill
  requires pattern [PATT] 1 and spirit [SPIR] 1 to begin to study.
  This skill costs 100 silver per month of study.

  adjacent regions. The mage should use the syntax CAST Gate_Lore
  DETECT in order to detect these nearby Gates. Also at level 2 Gate
  Lore, the mage may perform a random gate jump without being
  restricted to the same level; use CAST Gate_Lore RANDOM LEVEL UNITS
  <unit> ... to use this option.  The mage may also now carry 100
  weight units through a Gate when doing a random jump.

gate lore [GATE] 3: A mage with Gate Lore skill 3 and higher can step
  through a Gate into another region containing a specific Gate. To

  <unit> ... <number> specifies the Gate that the mage will jump to.
  UNITS is followed by a list of units to follow the mage through the
  gate (the mage always jumps through the gate). At level 3, the mage
  may carry 15 weight units through the Gate (including the mage).
  Also, a level 3 or higher mage doing a random gate jump may carry
  1000 weight units through the Gate.

farsight [FARS] 1: A mage with this skill may obtain region reports on
  distant regions. The report will be as if the mage was in the
  distant region himself. The target region must be within 4 times the
  caster's skill level squared regions of the caster. Coordinates of
  locations not on the surface are scaled to the surface coordinates
  for this calculation. Attempting to view across different levels
  increases the distance by 4 per level difference. To use this skill,
  CAST Farsight REGION <x> <y> <z> where <x>, <y>, and <z> are the
  coordinates of the region that you wish to view. If you omit the <z>
  coordinate, the <z> coordinate of the caster's current region will
  be used. The <z> coordinate for the surface is '1' and the
  <z>-coordinate for the underworld is '2'. Note that Farsight cannot
  be used either into or out of the Nexus. Any other skills which the
  mage has which give region information will be used when farsight is
  used. This skill requires pattern [PATT] 1 and spirit [SPIR] 1 to
  begin to study. This skill costs 100 silver per month of study.

teleportation [TELE] 1: A mage with this skill may teleport himself
  across great distances, even without the use of a gate. The mage may
  teleport up to 30 weight units per skill level. The target region
  must be within 2 times the caster's skill level squared regions of
  the caster. Coordinates of locations not on the surface are scaled
  to the surface coordinates for this calculation. Attempting to view
  across different levels increases the distance by 4 per level
  difference. To use this skill, CAST Teleportation REGION <x> <y> <z>
  where <x>, <y>, and <z> are the coordinates of the region that you
  wish to teleport to. If you omit the <z> coordinate, the <z>
  coordinate of the caster's current region will be used. The <z>
  coordinate for the surface is '1' and the <z>-coordinate for the
  underworld is '2'. Note that Teleportation cannot be used either
  into or out of the Nexus. This skill requires gate lore [GATE] 1 and
  farsight [FARS] 2 to begin to study. This skill costs 100 silver per

  Portals, and the caster must be trained in Portal Lore. The caster
  may teleport units weighing up to 300 weight units times his skill
  level, to the target mage's region.  The target region must be
  within 2 times the caster's skill level squared regions of the
  caster. To use this skill, CAST Portal_Lore <target> UNITS <unit>
