  sky. At skill level 1, the mage can control small birds, sending
  them to an adjacent region to obtain a report on that region. (This
  skill only works on the surface of the world, as there are no birds
  elsewhere). To use this skill, CAST Bird_Lore DIRECTION <dir>, where
  <dir> is the direction the mage wishes the birds to report on. This
  skill requires earth lore [EART] 1 to begin to study. This skill
  costs 100 silver per month of study.
