  should use the COMBAT order to set it as his combat spell. This
  skill requires force [FORC] 1 to begin to study. This skill costs
  100 silver per month of study.

tactics [TACT] 1: Tactics allows the unit, and all allies, to gain a
  bonus to their attack and defense during first battle round. Bonus
  equals to the difference in skills but can be +3 at most. The army
