Skill reports:

farsight [FARS] 1: A mage with this skill may obtain region reports on
  distant regions. The report will be as if the mage was in the
  distant region himself. The target region must be within 4 times the
  caster's skill level squared regions of the caster. Coordinates of
  locations not on the surface are scaled to the surface coordinates
  for this calculation. Attempting to view across different levels
  increases the distance by 4 per level difference. To use this skill,
  CAST Farsight REGION <x> <y> <z> where <x>, <y>, and <z> are the
  coordinates of the region that you wish to view. If you omit the <z>
  coordinate, the <z> coordinate of the caster's current region will
  be used. The <z> coordinate for the surface is '1' and the
  <z>-coordinate for the underworld is '2'. Note that Farsight cannot
  be used either into or out of the Nexus. Any other skills which the
  mage has which give region information will be used when farsight is
  used. This skill requires pattern [PATT] 1 and spirit [SPIR] 1 to
  begin to study. This skill costs 100 silver per month of study.

mining [MINI] 1: This skill deals with all aspects of extracting raw
  metals and gems from the earth. They tend to be found more often in
  mountainous regions, but may be found elsewhere as well. A unit with
  this skill may PRODUCE iron [IRON] at a rate of 1 per man-month.
  This skill costs 10 silver per month of study.
